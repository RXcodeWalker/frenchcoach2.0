# Verification Log

## S1 Verification Gate

Date: 2026-07-07

- Full suite run: `npm test` -> **250/250 tests passed** (24 test files) at gate time.
- L2 scorer inspection completed for:
  - `src/domain/igcse/rubric.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/canonical.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/types.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/prompt.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/schema.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/scoreSpeaking.ts`
- Golden transcript end-to-end verification:
  - Source test: `src/domain/igcse/judgement/__tests__/scoreSpeaking.test.ts` (`happy path`).
  - Expected shape/value check matched:
    - `rolePlay.total = 9`
    - `communication.mark = 8`
    - `qualityOfLanguage.mark = 8`
    - `total = 25`
- Typecheck run: `npm run typecheck` -> repo-wide failures remain in legacy UI files; no S2 scoring scope changes attempted there.

Status: **S1 gate met for scoring-engine scope**.

## S2 Layer 1 Evidence Signals

Date: 2026-07-07

Implemented detectors (deterministic, unit-tested):

- Time-frame alignment detector (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/timeFrame.ts`)
- Word/response counts per question (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/counts.ts`)
- Filler density per question (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/fillers.ts`)
- Two-part-task `partsAddressed` detector (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/parts.ts`)
- Evidence composer (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/buildEvidence.ts`)

Transcript shape extension (optional inputs only):

- `expectedTimeFrame?: TimeFrame` on conversation turns
- `partsExpected?: 1 | 2` on role-play tasks

Test artifacts:

- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/timeFrame.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/counts.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/fillers.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/parts.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/buildEvidence.golden.test.ts`

Adversarial required-pass confusion cases were implemented and passing for:

- `c'est` vs `c'était`
- present response to `récemment` / `la semaine dernière` cue -> `misaligned`
- `j'ai faim` (present) vs `j'ai mangé` (past)
- `je venais` vs `vous venez`
- futur proche (`je vais + inf`) vs literal present (`je vais à ...`)
- imparfait `-ais` vs conditionnel `-rais`

Regression results:

- Full suite run after S2 changes: `npm test` -> **279/279 tests passed** (29 test files).
- Golden evidence regression: `buildEvidence.golden.test.ts` passing.
- S1 golden transcript regression remains passing (`scoreSpeaking.test.ts` happy path).
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` still fails in pre-existing legacy UI files outside S2 scope.

### PROVISIONAL — Time-Frame Classifier

Even with the adversarial confusion fixtures passing, self-authored fixtures do not prove correctness on unseen French responses.

Logged commitment for S3+:

- Manually spot-check classifier output against the first **3-5 real teacher transcripts** once S3 ingestion is available.
- Audit per-response `TimeFrame` output against the actual French.
- Keep this signal **advisory** for Phase A until that held-out manual check passes.

## docs/architecture/ removed

Date: 2026-08-31

All files under `docs/architecture/` (00-overview-and-rationale, 01-cambridge-rubric-source,
02-scoring-pipeline-architecture, 03-validation-strategy, 04-frontend-pipeline,
05-deprecated-v1-removals, roadmap, rubric-sources, learn-feedback-contract,
pronunciation-practice-boundary, verification-log) were deleted from the working tree.

Reason: the docs assumed validation against real teacher/examiner-graded transcripts
(the S3/S6/S9/S12 phased corpus plan above, including the "3-5 real teacher transcripts"
commitment logged for S2 just above this entry) — that plan no longer reflects the actual
direction. The S-numbered roadmap phases referenced throughout this log predate the removal
and should not be treated as the current plan.

No replacement design docs exist yet. Until they do, treat `src/domain/igcse/` and its own
tests as the only authority on scoring-pipeline behavior — do not infer rationale, validation
strategy, or rollout order from git history of the deleted files. `CLAUDE.md` has been updated
accordingly.

## Documentation migration Stage 6a — dead-citation repair touching Assessment Engine code

Date: 2026-09-01

Stage 6a of the documentation system migration repaired dead citations to the deleted
`docs/architecture/` files across the repo. This entry covers only the Assessment Engine
sites touched, since those fall under this file's scope per `CLAUDE.md`'s Assessment Engine
change procedure — no other Assessment Engine behavior changed, comments only.

- `src/domain/igcse/guardrails/__tests__/syntheticManifest.ts` — the five-item examiner-report
  failure taxonomy was previously commented as a "verbatim" copy from the deleted
  `03-validation-strategy.md §5.1`. Reclassified: this file is now documented as the source of
  record for that taxonomy (the document it was originally transcribed from no longer exists
  to verify fidelity against), not a copy of a surviving original.
- `src/domain/igcse/guardrails/{types,config,quoteVerification,insufficientEvidence}.ts` — header
  comments citing the deleted `02-scoring-pipeline-architecture.md §3.5` and `roadmap S6` were
  repointed to `docs/systems/assessment-engine.md` (new in Stage 5) or restated without the dead
  citation. No threshold, type, or logic changed; `GUARDRAILS_VERSION` was not bumped because no
  guardrail behavior changed.
- `src/domain/igcse/envelope/types.ts` — a comment claiming an "S4 entry" in
  `docs/architecture/verification-log.md` was corrected: no such entry exists in this file (the
  actual verification log), and the design doc that comment originally cited no longer exists.
  The listed simplifications (temperature/seed dropped, predictedGrade omitted, etc.) are
  restated as current fact without a false citation.
- `scripts/scoring/providers/{groqJudge,geminiJudge}.ts` — same false
  `docs/architecture/verification-log.md` citation for the Gemini/Groq provider-swap rationale,
  corrected to note plainly that this rationale was never recorded anywhere that survives.

Verified: `npm run score:golden` and the guardrails `__tests__/` suite (including
`version-pin.test.ts`) still pass after these comment-only edits — see the Stage 6 gate run
below for the full command list and result.

## Phase 1.1 — Exam IDOR fix (store-level owner scoping)

Date: 2026-09-09

Closed the cross-user read/overwrite hole on the server scoring path. The
scoring service (`server/index.ts`) uses the Supabase **service key**, so RLS
`owner read` policies do nothing for it; the store code is the only
enforcement point.

Changes:
- `scripts/scoring/supabaseEnvelopeStore.ts` — `load`, `list`, `listBySession`,
  and the `saveOriginal` 23505-recovery select now filter
  `.eq('user_id', options.userId)`. A lost idempotency race can no longer
  return a foreign envelope.
- `scripts/stt/supabaseTranscriptStore.ts` — `load`, `list`, `getLastAttemptAt`
  now filter `.eq('user_id', options.userId)`. `save()` does an ownership
  pre-check (`select('user_id').eq('session_id', …)`) and throws a new typed
  `TranscriptOwnershipError` instead of upserting over a row owned by another
  user (PK is `session_id` alone). Table PK unchanged — app-level check is the
  smaller fix.
- `backend/supabase/migrations/20260909120000_scope_original_envelope_index_by_user.sql`
  (separate repo) — drops `scoring_envelopes_one_original_per_session`
  (`unique (session_id) where regraded_from is null`), recreates it as
  `unique (user_id, session_id) where regraded_from is null`; adds a covering
  `(user_id, session_id)` index.
- `src/screens/ExamMode.tsx` — free-play sessionId is now
  `exam-sim-${crypto.randomUUID()}` (was `exam-sim-${Date.now()}`, enumerable).
  Defence-in-depth; the store scoping is the actual fix. Single call site
  verified; nothing parses the prefix.
- `server/index.ts` — `POST /score` 500 handler no longer echoes the raw
  exception string to the client (generic `"scoring failed"` + server-side
  `console.error` with the stack). With the scoped stores, `GET /score` for a
  foreign sessionId already falls through to 404 (no code change needed — no
  403 existed on that path).

Verified:
- `npx vitest run scripts/` → 18 files, 89 passed (includes the extended
  `supabaseEnvelopeStore.test.ts` / `supabaseTranscriptStore.test.ts`:
  scoped-read `.eq('user_id', …)` assertions, foreign-row-filtered read cases,
  and a `save()` foreign-owner rejection case).
- `npm run score:golden` → 5/5 goldens match (no pipeline behavior change).
- `npm run typecheck` / `typecheck:server` clean. `typecheck:scripts` shows
  the 3 pre-existing errors in the two store test files (unrelated fixture
  shape / tuple-index issues present before this change); no new errors.
- `eslint` clean on all touched files.
- `backend/supabase/tests/exam_idor.test.mjs` (new) — written to the existing
  `.test.mjs` pattern (two anon users; asserts B cannot read/overwrite A's
  envelope/transcript rows, A can read its own, and the migration's
  per-(user,session) unique index behaves). **Not executed locally — Docker /
  `npx supabase start` was unavailable in this session.** To run in backend CI
  or against a local stack.
