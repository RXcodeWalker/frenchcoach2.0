# Verification Log

## S1 Verification Gate

Date: 2026-07-07

- Full suite run: `npm test` -> **250/250 tests passed** (24 test files) at gate time.
- L2 scorer inspection completed for:
  - `src/domain/igcse/rubric.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/canonical.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/types.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/prompt.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/schema.ts`
  - `src/domain/igcse/judgement/scoreSpeaking.ts`
- Golden transcript end-to-end verification:
  - Source test: `src/domain/igcse/judgement/__tests__/scoreSpeaking.test.ts` (`happy path`).
  - Expected shape/value check matched:
    - `rolePlay.total = 9`
    - `communication.mark = 8`
    - `qualityOfLanguage.mark = 8`
    - `total = 25`
- Typecheck run: `npm run typecheck` -> repo-wide failures remain in legacy UI files; no S2 scoring scope changes attempted there.

Status: **S1 gate met for scoring-engine scope**.

## S2 Layer 1 Evidence Signals

Date: 2026-07-07

Implemented detectors (deterministic, unit-tested):

- Time-frame alignment detector (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/timeFrame.ts`)
- Word/response counts per question (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/counts.ts`)
- Filler density per question (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/fillers.ts`)
- Two-part-task `partsAddressed` detector (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/parts.ts`)
- Evidence composer (`src/domain/igcse/evidence/buildEvidence.ts`)

Transcript shape extension (optional inputs only):

- `expectedTimeFrame?: TimeFrame` on conversation turns
- `partsExpected?: 1 | 2` on role-play tasks

Test artifacts:

- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/timeFrame.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/counts.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/fillers.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/parts.test.ts`
- `src/domain/igcse/evidence/__tests__/buildEvidence.golden.test.ts`

Adversarial required-pass confusion cases were implemented and passing for:

- `c'est` vs `c'était`
- present response to `récemment` / `la semaine dernière` cue -> `misaligned`
- `j'ai faim` (present) vs `j'ai mangé` (past)
- `je venais` vs `vous venez`
- futur proche (`je vais + inf`) vs literal present (`je vais à ...`)
- imparfait `-ais` vs conditionnel `-rais`

Regression results:

- Full suite run after S2 changes: `npm test` -> **279/279 tests passed** (29 test files).
- Golden evidence regression: `buildEvidence.golden.test.ts` passing.
- S1 golden transcript regression remains passing (`scoreSpeaking.test.ts` happy path).
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` still fails in pre-existing legacy UI files outside S2 scope.

### PROVISIONAL — Time-Frame Classifier

Even with the adversarial confusion fixtures passing, self-authored fixtures do not prove correctness on unseen French responses.

Logged commitment for S3+:

- Manually spot-check classifier output against the first **3-5 real teacher transcripts** once S3 ingestion is available.
- Audit per-response `TimeFrame` output against the actual French.
- Keep this signal **advisory** for Phase A until that held-out manual check passes.

## docs/architecture/ removed

Date: 2026-08-31

All files under `docs/architecture/` (00-overview-and-rationale, 01-cambridge-rubric-source,
02-scoring-pipeline-architecture, 03-validation-strategy, 04-frontend-pipeline,
05-deprecated-v1-removals, roadmap, rubric-sources, learn-feedback-contract,
pronunciation-practice-boundary, verification-log) were deleted from the working tree.

Reason: the docs assumed validation against real teacher/examiner-graded transcripts
(the S3/S6/S9/S12 phased corpus plan above, including the "3-5 real teacher transcripts"
commitment logged for S2 just above this entry) — that plan no longer reflects the actual
direction. The S-numbered roadmap phases referenced throughout this log predate the removal
and should not be treated as the current plan.

No replacement design docs exist yet. Until they do, treat `src/domain/igcse/` and its own
tests as the only authority on scoring-pipeline behavior — do not infer rationale, validation
strategy, or rollout order from git history of the deleted files. `CLAUDE.md` has been updated
accordingly.

## Documentation migration Stage 6a — dead-citation repair touching Assessment Engine code

Date: 2026-09-01

Stage 6a of the documentation system migration repaired dead citations to the deleted
`docs/architecture/` files across the repo. This entry covers only the Assessment Engine
sites touched, since those fall under this file's scope per `CLAUDE.md`'s Assessment Engine
change procedure — no other Assessment Engine behavior changed, comments only.

- `src/domain/igcse/guardrails/__tests__/syntheticManifest.ts` — the five-item examiner-report
  failure taxonomy was previously commented as a "verbatim" copy from the deleted
  `03-validation-strategy.md §5.1`. Reclassified: this file is now documented as the source of
  record for that taxonomy (the document it was originally transcribed from no longer exists
  to verify fidelity against), not a copy of a surviving original.
- `src/domain/igcse/guardrails/{types,config,quoteVerification,insufficientEvidence}.ts` — header
  comments citing the deleted `02-scoring-pipeline-architecture.md §3.5` and `roadmap S6` were
  repointed to `docs/systems/assessment-engine.md` (new in Stage 5) or restated without the dead
  citation. No threshold, type, or logic changed; `GUARDRAILS_VERSION` was not bumped because no
  guardrail behavior changed.
- `src/domain/igcse/envelope/types.ts` — a comment claiming an "S4 entry" in
  `docs/architecture/verification-log.md` was corrected: no such entry exists in this file (the
  actual verification log), and the design doc that comment originally cited no longer exists.
  The listed simplifications (temperature/seed dropped, predictedGrade omitted, etc.) are
  restated as current fact without a false citation.
- `scripts/scoring/providers/{groqJudge,geminiJudge}.ts` — same false
  `docs/architecture/verification-log.md` citation for the Gemini/Groq provider-swap rationale,
  corrected to note plainly that this rationale was never recorded anywhere that survives.

Verified: `npm run score:golden` and the guardrails `__tests__/` suite (including
`version-pin.test.ts`) still pass after these comment-only edits — see the Stage 6 gate run
below for the full command list and result.
